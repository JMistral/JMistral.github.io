Welcome to my personal website! Shoot me email _hardplaying@hotmail.com (yes I have a cool email address)_ if you want any of my source codes shared on my site. You can also visit [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiaming-chen-data-analyst/) page.

# [](#header-1)Statistical Computing Using R
In this course we follow the book [_Introduction to Statistic Learning_ ](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). A great book for learning R and basic EDA skills as well. And most importantly, our professor Dr.Sonderegger shares **lots of** wonderful and well explained R source code on [his personal page](https://dereksonderegger.github.io/578/) 👏

Here's my homework code, I share them just for fun 👻
> [Choosing degree of freedom? (examples with KNN regression and linear regression)](HW4_JCHEN)

> [Resampling(LOOCV, bootstrapping, K-fold CrossValidation)](HW5_STA578)

> [Lasso and Ridge Regression](HW6_STA578)



# [](#header-2)Data Analyst with Udacity
[my GitHub repo](https://github.com/JMistral/DataAnalyst_Udacity) for this program

_new update!_ I just got some cool data from this [website](http://www.gapminder.org/data/) about sugar and food consumption all over the world.

It's really exciting to explore some new sweet secrets!

Which country is the most rich one regarding food available per capita per day in the year 1961?

**Switzerland!**, it has on average 3500 kcal food available per person in 1961, it's almost the same level as Canada in the year of 2001.

[R sourcecode](sweetie)

I will keep updating this project as I move on.



# [](#header-3)Image Processing Using MATLAB and Python

We're using the famous _Digital Image Processing (Gonzalez 4th edition)_ for this course. Some of my homework code in MATLAB can be found in [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/JMistral/ImageProcessingEE542).

> Have you tried to apply **Butterworth Filter** in spatial domain? It's usually applied in spatial frequency domain, but I tried to use inverse FFT to find the spatial convolution kernel of Butterworth and then convolute image and the filter kernel in spatial domain. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/JMistral/ImageProcessingEE542/blob/master/HW6main.m). Moving average's frequency response is also included.

>  **Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)**, examples of different kernel size. [MATLAB code](https://github.com/JMistral/ImageProcessingEE542/blob/master/HW5main.m)


> Kaggle Project: Image Augmentation and Deep Learning. Some useful tutorial can be found [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/image-augmentation-deep-learning-keras/)
