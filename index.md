# [](#header-1)Statistical Computing Using R
In this course we follow the book [_Introduction to Statistic Learning_ ](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). A great book for learning R and basic EDA skills as well. And most importantly, our professor Dr.Sonderegger shares **lots of** wonderful and well explained R source code on [his personal page](https://dereksonderegger.github.io/578/) 👏

Here's my homework code, I share them just for fun 👻
