Welcome to my personal website! Shoot me email _hardplaying@hotmail.com (yes I have a cool email address)_ if you want any of my source codes shared on my site. You can also visit [my LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jiaming-chen-data-analyst/) page.

# [](#header-1)Statistical Computing Using R
In this course we follow the book [_Introduction to Statistic Learning_ ](http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~gareth/ISL/). A great book for learning R and basic EDA skills as well. And most importantly, our professor Dr.Sonderegger shares **lots of** wonderful and well explained R source code on [his personal page](https://dereksonderegger.github.io/578/) 👏

Here's my homework code, I share them just for fun 👻
> [Resampling(LOOCV, bootstrapping, K-fold)](HW5_STA578)

> [Lasso and Ridge Regression](HW6_STA578)

# [](#header-2)Image Processing Using MATLAB and Python

We're using the famous _Digital Image Processing (Gonzalez 4th edition)_ for this course. Some of my homework code in MATLAB can be found in [my GitHub repo](https://github.com/JMistral/ImageProcessingEE542).

> Have you tried to apply **Butterworth Filter** in spatial domain? It's usually applied in spatial frequency domain, but I tried to use inverse FFT to find the spatial convolution kernel of Butterworth and then convolute image and the filter kernel in spatial domain. The code can be found [here](https://github.com/JMistral/ImageProcessingEE542/blob/master/HW6main.m). Moving average's frequency response is also included.

>  **Laplacian of Gaussian (LoG)**, examples of different kernel size. [MATLAB code](https://github.com/JMistral/ImageProcessingEE542/blob/master/HW5main.m)


> Kaggle Project: Image Augmentation and Deep Learning. Some useful tutorial can be found [here](https://machinelearningmastery.com/image-augmentation-deep-learning-keras/)
